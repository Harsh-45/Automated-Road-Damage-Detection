# Automated Road Damage Detection

This repository contains an Automated Road Damage Detection model implemented using YOLOv8, along with a Flask web application for deployment. Users can upload images to the web application, which will then generate results indicating the detected road damages.

## Dataset
The model has been trained using the following datasets:
- [Dataset 1](link_to_dataset_1)
- [Dataset 2](link_to_dataset_2)
- [Dataset 3](link_to_dataset_3)

## Colab Files
Two versions of Colab files are available:
- `Automated_Road_Damage_Detection_V1.ipynb`: Description of version 1.
- `Automated_Road_Damage_Detection_V2.ipynb`: The final version.

## Video Link
A video demonstrating the usage and results of the Automated Road Damage Detection model can be found [here]([link_to_video](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cw2L41ZO_cSlI6BW4bLh8W-gTW2-jpS2?usp=sharing)).

## Test Results


## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/road_damage_detection.git
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```
4. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to access the web application.
5. Upload an image containing road damage to see the detection results.
